Polymorphic Pets
================

A small program to remind you what polymorphism is. Could be useful as a warmup or connect exercise in a [Learning Hour](https://sammancoaching.org/learning_hours/index.html). What greeting would you get? 

Feel free to send me a pull request with additional pets.
